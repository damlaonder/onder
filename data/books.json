    "My Review": "people say they wish they could read a certain book for the first time again. this is my third time reading the idiot. and it would be such an unfortunate thing if i said i wish i could read it for the first time again. <br/><br/>there is no competition when i say this is my favorite book. <br/><br/>the first time i read it, it was fall (2021) of my sophomore year of college - the first ‘real’ year since my freshman year was online. i didn’t know much then. <br/><br/>the second time was summer of 2022 in turkey. i reread in preparation of reading either/or. i still didn’t know much. <br/><br/>i’m about to start my last semester of college, and i know something now. and having a little bit more knowledge from my experience of college, unrequited love, language, and figuring out what i’m doing with my life … made this book EVEN BETTER the third time around ",

    "My Review": "wow. beyond lucky that this was my first jane austen novel. the portrayal of sisterhood, and their respective experiences of unrequited love, was iconic. loved that while they seemed to be complete opposites of each other in the beginning, they both hold parts of their sister, and that showed more as i continued to read. so much drama and emotion, i was in a constant state of awe. couldn’t shut up about it and will never shut up about it.

    "My Review": "i really believe this is an amazing book. but i think it is even better for those who grew up in a place in which the language closest to their heart was not the primary language of their environment. to understand and explain how we use language to express ourselves and how to feel connected is so beautiful. <br/><br/>to know more than one language and to understand the feeling of being able to express parts of yourself or your feelings in certain languages is something we should be talking about more. this books was so cool to dive deeply into how language is more than just the words we speak and write.
